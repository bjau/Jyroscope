#### Benefits
- No dependencies
- Easy to install without ROS (e.g., works on Windows and Mac)
- Simple to program: uses dependency injection
- Efficient run-time translation of Java classes to ROS message files (no need for separate pre-compilation)

#### Disadvantages
- Work in progress (buggy, not tested)
- Only supports publish/subscribe (e.g., no support for services)
